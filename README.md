Here are given the basic steps to install REST-for-physics on the CC IN2P3 cluster.

We need Root and Geant4 (for simulations with restG4) installed for REST-for-physics installation and use.
- Root version 6.26/10 is required
- Geant4 version 11.0.3 is recommended and support will be given with this version. You can decide to use version 10.7 but in case of crash we can't give support.

The first section explains how to install and use Miniconda in order to get the good versions of Root and Geant4.
It allows to create environments enclosing the desired versions, without interfering with the version that you may already have installed for other purposes.
This step is not mandatory, and you can directly go to the [REST-for-physics installation step.](#installing-rest-for-physics)

# Installing Miniconda

Some [helpful documentation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for Miniconda installation.

1. Get the last version of miniconda

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
2. Use the executable

```
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
``` 
Then follow the instruction on your console

3. You can choose to initiate conda in your shell. This step is not mandatory. 

```
miniconda3/bin/conda init <shell_name>
```

# Creating environment

1. Creating an environment with the right version of Geant4. [Some help](https://github.com/conda-forge/geant4-feedstock) for installing Geant4 with conda.

- For that we need the conda-forge channel

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

- Now we can create our environement that will eventually contain geant4 and Root.

```
conda create -n <environment_name> geant4==11.0.3
```
This step can take several minutes.

- Once it's done you can activate your environement. This is really important for the installation of Root in the same environement.

```
conda activate <environment_name>
``` 

2. Installing in this environement the right version of Root 

- For Root we need to change the priority of the conda-forge channel. 

```
conda config --set channel_priority false
```

- Now we can install Root

```
conda install root==6.26.10
```

This step can take several minutes, even half an hour.
Time for coffee :coffee:

> It's really important here to precise the version of Root. 
> Otherwise this step can take hours.


## Troubleshooting

- packages not found
>
```console
PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:
- geant4==11.0.3
```
because conda-forge isn't setup as priority channel. Please do
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

- conda command does not exist
>
```console
command not found: conda
```
have to set up in the bashrc or zshrc

# Installing REST-for-physics

Now we have the right versions of Root and Geant4, let's install REST.

- [Useful slides](https://indico.capa.unizar.es/event/26/timetable/?view=standard) for installation
- [REST-for-physics github page](https://github.com/rest-for-physics)

## Instruction for installing REST at ~/

> Careful: 
> - Please change the path to your corresponding repository!
> - If not already done, first activate the conda environement we just created by doing `conda activate <environment_name>` 

```
cd ~/
mkdir REST-for-physics
cd REST-for-physics
mkdir rest-framework
cd rest-framework
git clone https://github.com/rest-for-physics/framework.git .
python pull-submodules.py â€“latest:master
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/REST-for-physics/rest-framework/install/master -DREST_ALL_LIBS=ON -DREST_G4=ON -DREST_GARFIELD=OFF -DREST_MPFR=OFF
make <-j8> install
```

## Troubleshooting

- If crash with mpfr library
```
conda install mpfr
```
